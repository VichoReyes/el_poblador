# Testing Strategy for Game Package

## Current Testing Approach

The game package currently uses Go's standard testing framework with tests located alongside source files (`*_test.go`). Tests focus on:

- Game initialization and setup
- Turn progression through phases
- Player actions and state changes
- Game flow validation

## Current Testing Problems

### 1. **Integration Test Complexity**
- Tests like `TestInitialSettlementsRender` are doing too many things in a single test
- Long test functions that test multiple game states and transitions
- Difficult to isolate specific failures or edge cases

### 2. **State Management Testing**
- Game state changes are tested through full game flows rather than isolated state transitions
- Hard to test specific phase transitions without going through entire game sequences
- Limited testing of error conditions and invalid state transitions

### 3. **Mocking and Isolation**
- Tests depend on real board and player implementations
- Difficult to test game logic in isolation from board rendering and player resource management
- No clear separation between unit tests and integration tests

### 4. **Test Data Management**
- Test data is hardcoded in test functions
- No reusable test fixtures or helper functions for common game setups
- Difficult to test edge cases with specific game configurations

### 5. **Phase Testing**
- Phases are tested indirectly through game actions
- Limited testing of phase-specific logic and state validation
- No testing of phase transitions with invalid inputs

## Possible Solutions to Evaluate

### 1. **Test Structure Reorganization**
- Separate unit tests from integration tests
- Create test suites for different game components (phases, players, game state)
- Use table-driven tests for similar test scenarios

### 2. **Mocking Strategy**
- Create interfaces for board and player dependencies
- Use mocks to isolate game logic testing
- Implement test doubles for complex game components

### 3. **Test Helper Functions**
- Create helper functions for common game setups
- Implement test fixtures for different game states
- Build utilities for validating game state consistency

### 4. **Phase Testing Improvements**
- Test each phase in isolation
- Create phase-specific test utilities
- Test phase transitions with various input conditions

### 5. **Property-Based Testing**
- Consider using property-based testing for game rules
- Test invariants that should always hold true
- Generate random but valid game states for testing

### 6. **Test Coverage Analysis**
- Identify untested code paths
- Focus on testing critical game logic and edge cases
- Ensure all phase transitions are covered

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: Reorganize existing tests for better isolation and readability
2. **Medium Priority**: Create test helper functions and fixtures
3. **Low Priority**: Implement comprehensive mocking strategy
4. **Future Consideration**: Property-based testing for game rules

## Testing Goals

- **Reliability**: Tests should be deterministic and not flaky
- **Maintainability**: Tests should be easy to understand and modify
- **Coverage**: Critical game logic should have comprehensive test coverage
- **Performance**: Tests should run quickly to encourage frequent execution
