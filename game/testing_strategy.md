# Testing Strategy for Game Package

## Current Testing Approach

The game package currently uses Go's standard testing framework with tests located alongside source files (`*_test.go`). Tests focus on:

- Game initialization and setup
- Turn progression through phases
- Player actions and state changes
- Game flow validation

## Current Testing Problems

### Integration Test Complexity
- Tests like `TestInitialSettlementsRender` are doing too many things in a single test
- Long test functions that test multiple game states and transitions
- Difficult to isolate specific failures or edge cases

### State Management Testing
- Game state changes are tested through full game flows rather than isolated state transitions
- Hard to test specific phase transitions without going through entire game sequences
- Limited testing of error conditions and invalid state transitions

### Test Data Management
- Test data is hardcoded in test functions
- No reusable test fixtures or helper functions for common game setups
- Difficult to test edge cases with specific game configurations

### Phase Testing
- Phases are tested indirectly through game actions
- Limited testing of phase-specific logic and state validation
- No testing of phase transitions with invalid inputs

## Possible Solutions to Evaluate

### 1. **Test Structure Reorganization**
- Separate unit tests from integration tests
- Create test suites for different game components (phases, players, game state)
- Use table-driven tests for similar test scenarios

### 3. **Test Helper Functions**
- Create helper functions for common game setups
- Implement test fixtures for different game states
- Build utilities for validating game state consistency

### 4. **Phase Testing Improvements**
- Test each phase in isolation
- Create phase-specific test utilities
- Test phase transitions with various input conditions

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: Reorganize existing tests for better isolation and readability
2. **Medium Priority**: Create test helper functions and fixtures

## Testing Goals

- **Reliability**: Tests should be deterministic and not flaky
- **Maintainability**: Tests should be easy to understand and modify

## Testing non-goals

- **Performance**: It'll realistically be hard to make tests slow on this codebase
- **Coverage**: Aiming for this can cause flakiness.
