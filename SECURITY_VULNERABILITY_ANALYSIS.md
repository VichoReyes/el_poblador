# Development Card Security Vulnerabilities

## Problem Summary

During code review, several critical vulnerabilities were discovered that allow players to exploit development card mechanics by cancelling phases at strategic moments. These vulnerabilities stem from the pattern of consuming development cards **before** completing their effects, combined with allowing cancellation during card execution phases.

## Vulnerabilities Identified

### üö® Vulnerability #1: Road Building Card Exploitation
**Location**: `game/phase_dev_cards.go:47-48`, `game/phase_roads.go`
**Impact**: Player gets 1 free road instead of paying full card cost

**Exploit Steps**:
1. Player plays Road Building card ‚Üí `PlayDevCard()` removes card from deck
2. Player places first free road successfully  
3. Player cancels during second road placement
4. **Result**: Card consumed, but player only got 1 road instead of 2

### üö® Vulnerability #2: Year of Plenty Partial Resource Gain
**Location**: `game/phase_dev_cards.go:52-53`, `phaseYearOfPlenty.Confirm()`
**Impact**: Player gets 1 free resource instead of paying card cost

**Exploit Steps**:
1. Player plays Year of Plenty card ‚Üí card consumed
2. Player selects first resource ‚Üí immediately added to inventory
3. Player cancels before selecting second resource
4. **Result**: Card consumed, but player keeps first resource for free

### üö® Vulnerability #3: Monopoly Card Waste
**Location**: `game/phase_dev_cards.go:50-51`
**Impact**: Player can waste cards without benefit (less critical but still wrong)

**Exploit Steps**:
1. Player plays Monopoly card ‚Üí card consumed
2. Player cancels resource selection
3. **Result**: Card wasted, no resources gained (could be used to deny opponents information)

### üö® Vulnerability #4: Knight Card Incomplete Effects
**Location**: `game/phase_dev_cards.go:44-45`
**Impact**: Player can consume Knight card without completing robber placement

**Exploit Steps**:
1. Player plays Knight card ‚Üí card consumed, moved to played deck
2. Player cancels robber placement or card stealing
3. **Result**: Knight card effect incomplete but card still consumed

## Root Cause Analysis

The fundamental issue is the **timing of card consumption**:

```go
// PROBLEMATIC PATTERN - Card consumed BEFORE effect completion
func (p *phasePlayDevelopmentCard) Confirm() Phase {
    // ...
    player.PlayDevCard(card)  // ‚Üê Card consumed here
    return PhaseCardEffect()  // ‚Üê But effect can be cancelled
}
```

This creates a window where:
1. Card is removed from player's hand
2. Player enters effect phase  
3. Player can cancel and keep partial benefits
4. Card is gone but full effect wasn't completed

## Solution: No-Cancel Policy for Development Cards

**Approach**: Make development card phases non-cancellable once started, matching real Catan rules.

**Rationale**: 
- Simple implementation (just remove cancel methods)
- No complex state tracking/undo logic needed
- Matches physical game behavior (once you play a card, you commit to its effect)
- Eliminates all exploitation vectors

## Implementation Plan

### Files to Modify:

1. **`game/phase_dev_cards.go`**:
   - Remove `Cancel()` method from `phaseMonopoly`
   - Remove `Cancel()` method from `phaseYearOfPlenty`

2. **`game/phase_roads.go`**:
   - Modify `phaseRoadStart.Cancel()` to return `p` (no-op) when `isFree=true`
   - Modify `phaseRoadEnd.Cancel()` to return `p` (no-op) when `isFree=true`
   - Or remove Cancel methods entirely when triggered by development cards

3. **`game/phase_robber.go`**:
   - Consider removing cancel from robber phases when triggered by Knight card
   - May need to track the source of robber placement (dice roll vs Knight card)

### Code Changes:
```go
// BEFORE: Exploitable
func (p *phaseMonopoly) Cancel() Phase {
    return p.previousPhase  // ‚Üê Allows exploitation
}

// AFTER: Safe (method removed entirely)
// No Cancel() method = non-cancellable phase
```

## Future Prevention

### Testing Strategy (for future implementation):
1. **Direct exploit tests** - Test each vulnerability pattern explicitly
2. **State invariant tests** - Verify game state consistency after card effects
3. **Cancel-safety framework** - Generic tests that try cancelling at every point
4. **Property-based testing** - Fuzz testing with random cancel sequences
5. **Evil player simulation** - Tests that simulate malicious cancellation patterns

### Development Guidelines:
- **Never consume resources/cards before completing their full effect**
- **If partial completion is possible, implement proper rollback or make phase non-cancellable**
- **Test all cancellable phases for state consistency**
- **Consider whether each Cancel operation makes logical sense in game rules**
